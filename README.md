# React Js Dashboard - Responsive

## Live Link

- Project Live Link 1: [Live Demo - vercel.app](https://listing-react-dashboard.vercel.app/)
ReactJs Dashboard with Google Auth Sign-in/Sign-up feature.

## Project Description

I have developed this dashboard as part of an internship hiring assignment for Listed (https://listed.fans/). The dashboard is built using React.js along with a sign-in page that implements basic authentication using Google for user login and signup. To enhance my productivity and streamline my CSS workflow, I utilized SCSS, a CSS compiler engine.

The project is designed to be responsive across various devices; however, as we all know, achieving perfection in code is a constant process of iteration and improvement. Despite our best efforts, bugs can occasionally creep in, and as programmers, we embrace the task of identifying and resolving them.

To enhance the visual appeal of the dashboard, I incorporated some basic @keyframes animations. Although the initial UI design was provided exclusively for desktop screens, I used my creative imagination to design and adapt it for the rest of the screen sizes.

One of the standout features of this project is the dynamic linear chat and pie chart, which are constructed using data fetched from the API: ![https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population](https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population).
